# Desktop voice assistance 

It is well known that Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers. Here's a Python script for the Voice Assistant. A query for the assistant can be manipulated based on the user's needs.

The process of speech recognition involves converting audio into text. Siri, Alexa, and other voice assistants use this feature. With Python's Speech Recognition API, we can transform audio files into text that can be further processed. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how we can convert large or long audio files into text using Python's Speech Recognition API.

```bash
